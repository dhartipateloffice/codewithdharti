# Definition: Positional arguments are arguments that need to be passed in the same order as the function parameters. - order is comp
# Use: Ideal when the order of arguments is obvious and doesnâ€™t lead to confusion.

# Definition: Keyword arguments are passed using the parameter name, allowing you to specify the argument in any order. - any order by specifying name only as key value
# Use: Useful for functions with many parameters or optional parameters, as they improve readability and avoid errors in order.
